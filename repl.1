.SH "NAME"
\fBrepl\fR \- sometimes you \fIreally\fR need a repl
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBrepl\fR \fI[options]\fR \fIcommand\fR <\|\.\|\.\|\.>
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBrepl\fR wraps a non\-interactive \fBcommand\fR in an interactive read\-eval\-print\-loop prompt\. Each line you type into the prompt is executed as arguments to \fBcommand\fR\. Anything written to standard output or standard error by the \fBcommand\fR is displayed\.
.P
If you have \fBrlwrap(1)\fR installed you'll automatically get the full benefits of readline: history, reverse searches, etc\.
.P
\fBrepl\fR is meant to wrap programs which accept command line arguments and print to the standard output\. It keeps no state between executed lines and, as such, cannot be used to replace \fBirb\fR or the Python REPL (for example)\.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Using \fBrepl\fR with \fBredis\-cli\fR:

$ repl redis\-cli
>> set name chris
OK
>> get name
chris
>> info
redis_version:1\.000
uptime_in_seconds:182991

.SH "COMPLETION"
Because \fBrlwrap\fR supports completion, \fBrepl\fR does too\. Any file in \fB~/\.repl\fR matching the name of the command you start \fBrepl\fR with will be used for completion\.
.P
For instance, a file named \fB~/\.repl/redis\-cli\fR containing "get set info" will cause "get", "set", and "info" to be tab completeable at the \fBrepl redis\-cli\fR prompt\.
.P
The directory searched for completion files can be configured using the \fBREPL_COMPLETION_DIR\fR environment variable\.
.SH "COMMAND HISTORY"
Because \fBrlwrap\fR supports command history, \fBrepl\fR does too\. Any file in \fB~/\fR matching the name of the command you start \fBrepl\fR with prefix with a dot and suffixed with "_history" will be used for completion\.
.P
For instance, a file named \fB~/\.redis\-cli_history\fR containing a newline separated list of "get set info" will cause "get", "set", and "info" to be reachable using the up arrow as command history at the \fBrepl redis\-cli\fR prompt\.
.P
The directory searched for history files can be configured using the \fBREPL_HISTORY_DIR\fR environment variable\.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
The following environment variables can be used to configure \fBrepl\fR's behaviour, and can be set permanently in the \fB~/\.repl\.conf\fR configuration file:
.SS "REPL_PROMPT"
the prompt to display before each line of input (defaults to \fB>>\fR)
.SS "REPL_DEBUG"
print out the expanded command before executing it
.SS "REPL_QUIET"
suppress superfluous output when inside a pipeline
.SS "REPL_HISTORY_DIR"
directory in which command history files are kept
.SS "REPL_COMPLETION_DIR"
directory in which command completion files are kept
